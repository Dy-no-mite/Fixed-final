<H3> The House is dirty with stuff everywhere<h3>
  <p> The house needs work in every direction, it's time to organize it in the best way we can and try to keep it clean! Better hurry up before the elders walk in
    and start going off on a ranting spree!

  </p>


  <h3>Methods of cleaning</h3>

<ol>
  <li> pick up objects off the floor or remove them out of the way especially in places they don't belong</li>
  <li> Throw away objects that serve no use in a fresh garbage bag</li>
  <li> remove any decorative fabrics or cushins and have them ready to be washed</li>
  <li> vaccum and/or wipe all the surfaces you can get to</li>
  <li> wash the fabrics and get new ones</li>
  <li> place object you need away neatly</li>
