  <p> T-rex's arms aren't the smallest amongst any general dinosaurs! That honor goes to the
    Carnotaurus. They can bench press 400 pounds so don't think that they won't beat you in Arm wrestling.</p>

    <p> Did you bring any gas masks? because they had bad breath, from eatin other things with a face no doubt!</p>

    <p> They lived for thirty years!!! They were on top of the food chain so they died of old age</p>
